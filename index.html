      <ol class="steps">
        <li>
          <strong>Quick chat.</strong>
          You tell me what you have today and what you want to be able to do.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Simple plan.</strong>
          I suggest a setup using the gear you already own, plus options if anything is missing.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>On-site setup.</strong>
          Everything gets installed, connected, tested, and walked through with you.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Clear hand-off.</strong>
          You get a simple guide and know which app/button/voice command does what.
