    <!-- FAQ -->
    <section id="faq" class="section section-alt">
      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
      
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What brands do you work with?</h3>
        <p>I work with all major smart home brands including Google Nest, Amazon Alexa, Apple HomeKit, Ring, Ecobee, Philips Hue, TP-Link, Lutron, August, and many others. I'll recommend the best options based on your existing setup and preferences.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Do I need to buy equipment before you come?</h3>
        <p>No. During our initial chat, I'll recommend specific products based on your needs and what you already own. You can purchase them yourself or I can include procurement in the service.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How long does a typical smart home setup take?</h3>
        <p>Most single-device installations (thermostat, doorbell, lock) take 1-2 hours. Whole-home setups can take 3-6 hours depending on complexity. I'll give you a time estimate after our initial discussion.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Can you install a smart thermostat if I have an older HVAC system?</h3>
        <p>In most cases, yes. During our consultation, I'll ask about your current system and determine compatibility. Some older systems may need a C-wire adapter, which I can install as part of the service.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What if something stops working after you leave?</h3>
        <p>I provide follow-up support to make sure everything continues working smoothly. Most issues can be resolved with a quick phone call or remote assistance.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Do you offer ongoing maintenance?</h3>
        <p>Yes! For property management clients and short-term rental hosts, I offer regular tech check-ins as part of property visits. For residential clients, I'm available on-call for tune-ups and troubleshooting.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How far do you travel?</h3>
        <p>My primary service area is Collingwood, Blue Mountains, and Wasaga Beach. I can travel to nearby communities with a small travel fee. Contact me to confirm your location.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Do you work with renters or only homeowners?</h3>
        <p>I work with both! For renters, I focus on non-permanent solutions like smart plugs, portable devices, and equipment that can move with you. Always check with your landlord before installing anything that requires wiring or permanent modification.</p>
