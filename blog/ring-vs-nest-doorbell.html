          You've decided you want a video doorbell. Smart choice. Being able to see and speak with visitors from anywhere, get package delivery alerts, and have video evidence if something goes wrong is incredibly valuable.
        </p>

        <p>
          But now comes the hard part: choosing between Ring and Google Nest. Both are excellent, both are popular, and both do basically the same thing. So which one should you buy?
        </p>

        <p>
          I've installed dozens of both in homes around Collingwood and the Blue Mountains. Here's an honest comparison to help you decide.
        </p>

        <h2>The Quick Answer</h2>

        <p><strong>Choose Ring if:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>You want the most affordable option with flexible subscription plans</li>
          <li>You need battery-powered flexibility (easy to install anywhere)</li>
          <li>You already use Amazon Alexa</li>
          <li>You want the option to add more Ring security devices later (cameras, alarm system)</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Choose Nest if:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>You want the best video quality and smart detection features</li>
          <li>You use Google Assistant and the Google ecosystem</li>
          <li>You prefer a sleeker, more modern design</li>
          <li>You're willing to pay a bit more for premium features</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Now let's dig into the details.</p>

        <h2>Video Quality</h2>

        <p>
          <strong>Winner: Nest (by a small margin)</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          Both offer excellent video, but Nest has a slight edge. The Nest Doorbell (Battery) shoots in 960p HDR with a 3:4 aspect ratio, giving you a taller view that captures packages on the ground and people's faces better than Ring's 16:9 format.
        </p>

        <p>
          Ring's Video Doorbell Pro 2 offers 1536p "Head-to-Toe HD" video, which is also very good. Both have night vision, and both let you zoom in after the fact.
        </p>

        <p>
          In real-world use, both are clear enough to identify faces and read license plates. You won't go wrong with either.
        </p>

        <h2>Smart Detection and Alerts</h2>

        <p>
          <strong>Winner: Nest</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          This is where Nest pulls ahead. Google's AI can distinguish between people, packages, animals, and vehicles—even without a subscription. Ring requires a subscription for person detection and doesn't offer package or animal detection at all.
        </p>

        <p>
          Why does this matter? Because you'll get fewer annoying alerts. Instead of being notified every time a car drives by or a squirrel runs across your porch, you only get alerts that matter—like when a person approaches or a package is delivered.
        </p>

        <p>
          Nest can also create activity zones (areas where you want to be alerted) and familiar face detection (it learns who lives there and can notify you when strangers appear).
        </p>

        <h2>Price and Subscription Costs</h2>

        <p>
          <strong>Winner: Ring</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          Ring is more affordable upfront and offers cheaper subscription plans.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Hardware costs (approximate Canadian pricing):</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Ring Video Doorbell (Battery): $130-150</li>
          <li>Ring Video Doorbell Pro 2: $330-350</li>
          <li>Nest Doorbell (Battery): $230-250</li>
          <li>Nest Doorbell (Wired): $230-250</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Subscription costs:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Ring Protect Basic: $4/month or $40/year (per device)</li>
          <li>Ring Protect Plus: $10/month or $100/year (unlimited devices)</li>
          <li>Nest Aware: $8/month or $80/year (all devices, 30 days of history)</li>
          <li>Nest Aware Plus: $15/month or $150/year (60 days of history, 10 days 24/7 recording)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Ring's per-device pricing makes sense if you only have one doorbell. But if you plan to add cameras later, Nest's "all devices" pricing becomes more attractive.
        </p>

        <p>
          Both offer basic functionality without a subscription (live view, two-way talk), but you need a subscription to save video clips and access smart alerts.
        </p>

        <h2>Installation and Power Options</h2>

        <p>
          <strong>Winner: Ring (more flexibility)</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          Both brands offer battery-powered and wired models, but Ring has more options and their battery life tends to be better.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Ring Video Doorbell (battery version) can last 6-12 months on a charge depending on usage and temperature. Nest's battery doorbell typically needs rechar
